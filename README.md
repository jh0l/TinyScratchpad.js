# Mini Navbar Node Editor for Mac ï£¿

We dont always want to create new project to test snippets of code. Somtimes we just need to run 3-4 lines of code to test a method or the result of some function you just thought about. I created this project exactly to address this issue. (:
run snippets of code directly through the navbar.
